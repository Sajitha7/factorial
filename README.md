This Python program is a factorial calculator that allows the user to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. It includes error handling for invalid inputs (negative numbers or non-integers) and provides the option to perform factorial calculations repeatedly.


Features : Recursive Factorial Calculation, Input Validation, Repetitive Calculations.



Usage:

Run the script in a Python environment. 

Enter a non-negative integer when prompted. If an invalid input is provided, the program will display an error message and prompt for a valid input. 

The program will calculate and display the factorial of the entered number.
